# Part I Instructions

**Thank you for participating in the Public Domain Map pilot!** 


Public Domain Map is a new collaborative mapping tool from [OpenStreetMap US](https://openstreetmap.us/) that allows volunteers to contribute to government datasets and OpenStreetMap simultaneously. Developed in collaboration with federal partners, Public Domain Map is designed to multiply the power and impact of volunteer mappers contributing to the public good by combining crowdsourcing efforts. Using familiar tools and workflows, volunteers will contribute map data that is reviewed by government agencies before publishing to OpenStreetMap and federal datasets. As a result, volunteer-contributed data can be leveraged by a greater number of agencies, citizens, companies, and nonprofits to better inform decision-making. 

## User Testing Overview
Your participation in the pilot will play a critical role in ensuring that Public Domain Map is accessible, functional, and an enjoyable experience. You should expect to spend XX-XX hours participating in this user testing process, depending on your experience with OpenStreetMap and/or your role as a mapper or validator.

The pilot will be broken into separate parts, each of which will conclude with a short feedback form that we ask all participants to complete. These forms will capture any challenges and feedback from the tasks completed. We encourage participants to capture screenshots of issues, bugs, etc. to be shared in the feedback forms.

If you have any questions or encounter roadblocks in completing the steps during the course of the pilot, please do not hesitate to reach out to info@publicdomainmap.org



## Step 1: Creating Your OpenStreetMap Account
*If you already have an OpenStreetMap account, skip ahead to Step 2.*

OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project to create a free editable world map. The power of OpenStreetMap is that it empowers anyone, anywhere in the world to add information to a collective map and use the data for any purpose. You can think of OSM as the “Wikipedia of maps” – it is an online database and global community of over 5 million registered users. This community collaborates to build a free and open map of the world to which anyone can contribute and which anyone can use in their own context. All that is needed to contribute to OSM is an internet connection and email address.

OpenStreetMap can, and has, been used for a wide variety of purposes - from disaster response to commercial use. The first organized use of OSM in disaster response was following the 2010 Haiti Earthquake. As high-resolution imagery of the affected area was made available to the public, over 600 individuals from the global OSM community began digitizing the imagery and tracing roads and other infrastructure. They made what quickly became the most detailed map of Port-au-Prince in existence, which was then used by search and rescue teams to help route supplies around the devastated capital and to coordinate many other aspects of the response and reconstruction effort.

### Creating an Account
To get started, you will need to create an account on www.openstreetmap.org. Please use the “Sign Up” tab in the top right corner to begin.

![](https://toolbox.hotosm.org/images/IntroOSM3.gif)

Please fill in all the fields in the form. We recommend using an email you have easy access to e.g. your personal email, as you will receive a confirmation email to verify your account. You will not receive any spam/marketing emails. Click the blue “Sign Up” button when finished.

Note: If a problem occurs, a problem message will appear. Make sure that the email you entered is the same as in the first two boxes and your password. If the box for the user name is red then someone else has already used the name and you have to look for another name.

Next, please read and accept the contributor terms and agreements by selecting where you are based (France, Germany, or the Rest of the World), and clicking the blue “Agree” button on the bottom of your screen.

![](https://toolbox.hotosm.org/images/IntroOSM6.gif)

To activate your account, please now check your email and click on the link provided. In some cases, it may take several minutes for you to receive your confirmation email. If you do not receive an email after 15 minutes, please check your spam folder. You may also need to use an alternate email if you used a work or school email, as your administrator settings may be blocking the email from coming through.

![](https://toolbox.hotosm.org/images/IntroOSM7.gif)

On the OpenStreetMap page, click Log In in the upper right corner. Enter your OpenStreetMap username and password then press Enter. You should now be logged in and you will see your username on the top right of the OpenStreetMap site.

### Complete the Walkthrough
The next step is to learn how to do basic mapping in OpenStreetMap. After you've logged in with you account, zoom in to anywhere on the map until the "Edit" button in the upper left-hand corner is no longer greyed out. Click on Edit (you may need to select the arrow to the right of edit, and select 'Edit with iD Editor').

This will bring you to the iD Editor. In the pop-up window, select "Start the Walkthrough". Complete the walkthrough.

If you do not receive the welcome message as shown above or if you would like to revisit the walkthrough in the future, you can always access the walkthrough in the iD Editor. Once in the iD Editor, select the "Help" option in the right-hand menu. In the Help menu, you can select "Start the Walkthrough".

## Step 2: OpenStreetMap US Tasking Manager
*If you already have signed into the OpenStreetMap US Tasking Manager, skip ahead to Step 3.*

The Tasking Manager is a mapping tool designed for the collaborative mapping process in OpenStreetMap. The purpose of the tool is to divide up a mapping project into smaller tasks that can be completed rapidly with many people working on the same overall area. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need the mapping reviewed. Originally built by Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, many instances of the Tasking Manager have been created to serve different audiences and purposes in the OpenStreetMap community. 

All Public Domain Map projects are hosted on the OpenStreetMap US Tasking Manager. 

### Sign in to the OpenStreetMap US Tasking Manager
Navigate to tasks.openstreetmap.us. To sign in, click on the ‘Log in’ button in the top right corner of the page. Once you click on the login button a popup will appear with the OpenStreetMap login form. Please enter your OSM username and password.

[insert animation]

The first time you are logging into Tasking Manager with your OSM username and password from the device you are using, an authorisation message will appear. Click ‘Grant Access’ so that your OSM login details will sync to the Tasking Manager. You will notice that your username now displays in the upper right hand corner of the page.

## Step 3: Complete the Onboarding Feedback Form
Fill out the Onboarding Feedback form below. After completing the survey, your OpenStreetMap account will be added to the Public Domain Map Testing Team and you will receive further instructions via email. 

*Please note: there may be several days between completion of this form and reciept of further instructions.*

```
Add any internal notes about the feedback form here:

- Add acknowledgement of participation & that data will go into the public domain, and data during pilot may not be contributed to OSM.
